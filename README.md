# Mastering Critical Skills in Algorithms with C++

Welcome to **Mastering Critical Skills in Algorithms with C++**! This repository contains the code implementations for an intensive algorithms course using C++. Each algorithm is explained in detail, and multiple implementations are provided, along with problem solutions to help reinforce your understanding.

## üìå Repository Overview
This repository serves as a collection of fundamental algorithms implemented in C++ with detailed explanations. The goal is to provide a structured learning experience for anyone looking to master algorithms through practical implementation.

## üìö Topics Covered
The repository covers a wide range of algorithms, including:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Explanation of BFS and its applications
- Iterative and recursive implementations
- BFS for graphs and trees

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Recursive and iterative DFS
- DFS for graphs and trees
- Cycle detection using DFS

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Binary Search
- Standard binary search implementation
- Variations such as lower bound and upper bound search
- Applications in problem-solving

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Graph Representation
- Adjacency matrix vs adjacency list
- Weighted and unweighted graphs
- Directed and undirected graphs

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Recursion Revision
- Understanding recursion depth and stack usage
- Common recursion problems and solutions
- Optimization techniques: Memoization and Tail Recursion

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort
- Comparative analysis of sorting techniques

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Topological Sort
- Explanation of topological ordering
- Implementation using Kahn‚Äôs algorithm (BFS)
